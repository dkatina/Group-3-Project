# Group-3-Project

## Summary

In this project we reconstructed a website with multiple pages linked through a nav bar.   
For additional incorporation of what we learned over week 1 we restyled the previouse mock   
login page and added it to our site.

## Work Division

#### Sarah Stodder   
Having had experience with linking html pages, and comfortable with various css stylings Sarah created the   
header and footer nav bars, created a logo, and the login button.
Her original code can be seen in the template_copy.html page and template.css.

This code was used in every single page, and Sarah used it to format majority of the pages.

#### Olashile Shinaba

Having had some technical difficulties with internet access Ola was a little behind on week 1 projects, but was still   
able to contribute and be an asset to the team. He was responsible for the Contact Us page and his original code can be seen
in contact.html and contact.css aling with sarah's template code incorperation.


#### Dylan Katina

Dylan was responsible for the remaining pages and his code can be seen in who_we_are.html,  where_we_work.html, what_we_do.html, and their accompanying css pages.   
All of which also contain Sarah's template code for the nav bars.

Dylan also finalized the styling and format accross the pages so it was uniform across all pages.
